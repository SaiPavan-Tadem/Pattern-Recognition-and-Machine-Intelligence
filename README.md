# Pneumonia detection with adaptive contrast enhancement and deep learning
This is an implimented project with the help of reference from original papers [Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Rays with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05225) and [Pneumonia Detection in chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342619947_Pneumonia_Detection_in_chest_X-ray_images_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_and_Transfer_Learning).you can also check [my project report here](https://github.com/SaiPavan-Tadem/Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Intelligence/blob/main/Report_PneumoniaDetection.pdf)
